        <h2>What is desertification?
        </h2>
        <p>As global temperatures rise and the human population expands,
           more of the planet is vulnerable to desertification which is defined as land degradation in arid,
           semiarid, and dry subhumid areas,
           it reduces productivity of dryland ecosystems by reducing plant cover,
           soil loss, loss of soil organic matter, and increasing sand dunes.
           It is mainly resulted from temporary climatic crises, especially droughts that occur periodically,
           and harmful human activities in vulnerable ecosystems. Human activities such as agriculture,
           pastoralism and deforestation in drylands often to alternate stable states that are resistant of further disturbance. Desertification has severe social and economic consequences for human population. The preventive action includes: integrating land in water management to protect soils from erosion, salinization, and other forms of degradation. Protecting the vegetative cover,
            which can be a major instrument for soil conservation against wind and water erosion.

        <h2>what is Afforestation?</h2>
        <p>
          Over the last decade, the talk on global warming and climate change has dominated major events and conferences. Politicians and global leaders have campaigned under the idea of helping combat the issues of global warming. As such, afforestation has been one of the most talked-about methods of dealing with global warming.

         It refers to the process of sowing seeds or planting trees in an area that does not have trees to create a forest. According to the Vocabulary, afforestation is “the conversion of bare or cultivated land into forest.” However, afforestation should not be confused with reforestation. Reforestation refers to planting trees in a land with a decreasing number of trees.

        <h2>Importance of Afforestation</h2>
        <p>
          Afforestation helps to reduce the pressure on preexisting natural forests regarding the demand for forest products by being an alternative source of such products.Afforestation is mostly done on the basis of commercial benefits. However, it still helps to reduce deforestation of existing forests as they take time to grow naturally and due to the increased demand for products can’t properly replenish its stock.
          Afforestation allows people to plant tree species more in demand.
       and afforestation helps to develop and restore long lost ecosystem areas. They also help to increase species biodiversity within those regions. Governments and organizations like Environmentbuddy are using afforestation to covert semi-arid or arid regions into productive regions which not only fights global warming and climate change but does it in a much more aesthetic manner!
